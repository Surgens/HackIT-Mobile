        HackIT hackathons are a catalyst for
        innovation and strive to spark a moment of creativity for the
        sake of technology. They provide an atmosphere of thinking and
        concentration that allows individuals to take relevant business
        problems and go about solving them in a 24-hour period. Starting
        from the bare bones of an idea, the participants form teams and
        work through the night seeing it through to the end. At the end
        of the event, participants have the opportunity to present his
        or hers work to a distinguished panel of judges. Business-relevant
        exemplary ideas have the added benefit of possibly being
        implemented beyond the HackIT.
